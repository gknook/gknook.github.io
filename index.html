</div>
<p class="mb-6">Hi! My name is Guido Knook, I'm a product leader with over 5 years of experience in developing and improving products. I started my product career at Mimi in 2014, when the company still had to officially incorporate. Especially in the first two years I gained practical experience in a lot of fields. From product marketing, to cultural and organizational development, hiring and interviewing, strategy setting and leadership. Since then my focus has been on Product Management/Leadership.</p>

<h2 class="font-semibold text-grey-lightest leading-normal tracking-wide text-2xl">Finding balance</h2>
<p class="mb-6">I believe that creating a great product is an exercise in balancing desirability, viability, and feasibility.</p>
<div class="w-2/3 mx-auto leading-none">
  <img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/gknook/image/upload/v1563725044/DVF_2x_hxdzmh.png" alt="Balancing product, Desirability, Feasibility and Viability">
</div>
<p class="mb-6">A successful product leader will take the constraints of desirability, feasibility and viability into account when creating a product and aims to harmonize this triad to achieve successful innovation.</p>
<ul class="mb-6 ml-4 list-disc">
  <li class="mb-2">
    <span class="font-bold">Desirability
    </span>
    refers to creating an innovation that people love to use, are attached to.</li>
  <li class="mb-2">
    <span class="font-bold">Feasibility</span>
    refers to the technical background of the innovation, whether it can be made.</li>
  <li class="mb-2">
    <span class="font-bold">Viability</span>
    is about the business of the innovation, a new product is not an innovation if it cannot be brought to the market.</li>
</ul>

<h2 class="font-semibold text-grey-lightest leading-normal tracking-wide text-2xl">Product</h2>
<p class="mb-6">I officially started at Mimi as a user experience designer, but quickly took on more responsibilities around the product as we grew. In those years I’ve worked both on B2C products, as well as B2B solutions.</p>
<ul class="mb-6 ml-4 list-disc">
  <li class="mb-2">
    <span class="font-bold">B2C example:</span>
    The Mimi Hearing Test, which has been featured by Apple many times, and is rated the #1 hearing test across the App Store.</li>
  <li class="mb-2">
    <span class="font-bold">B2B example:</span>
    Mimi’s Headphone SDK, which was responsible for beyerdynamic’s most successful product launch in their almost 100 year company history (the Aventho).</li>
</ul>
<p class="mb-6">Now I lead a team of 3 product managers, 1 user researcher and 1 design lead (and her team), while working closely with my research and engineering peers.</p>

<h2 class="font-semibold text-grey-lightest leading-normal tracking-wide text-2xl">Design</h2>
<p class="mb-6">My background is in strategic product design, which is the type of design that doesn’t just make things pretty, but focuses on balancing the triad above. Balancing technical feasibility, potential business value and customer needs to come to a successful solution for a real problem.</p>

<h2 class="font-semibold text-grey-lightest leading-normal tracking-wide text-2xl">Technical</h2>
<p class="mb-6">Although I don't have a degree in Computer Science my experience has made me technically adept. Mimi has forced me to gain a technical understanding fast, both on a software level and an audio level. Mimi's technology stack reaches from low-level Kalimba DSP code to native Swift and Kotlin code. Our core product is a software bundle consisting of DSP libraries and a user-facing SDK. That's all to say that many of the challenges I've been facing have been technical in nature. I've been loving this experience, and can only conclude that for me balancing a design approach with analytical thinking brings the best solutions.</p>
